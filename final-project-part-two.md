Storyboard: "The STEM Wealth Divide—Why Some Degrees Pay (and Others Don’t)"
1. Hook: The Broken Promise of STEM

The story opens by challenging the universal assumption that all STEM degrees guarantee financial success. A striking visual contrast—a split-screen of two graduates, one in tech and one in a lab—immediately frames the tension. The tech grad’s starting salary dwarfs the biologist’s, yet both were sold the same "STEM = prosperity" narrative. This section primes the audience to question which STEM paths actually deliver, using a bold callout: "Computer science grads out-earn biologists 3-to-1 in their first year—and carry less debt." The data here is U.S.-specific, focusing on Bachelor’s degrees to keep comparisons fair.
2. The Winners: Tech, Health, and Engineering

Here, we spotlight the STEM fields that live up to the hype. A dynamic bar chart reveals the top performers—computer science, nursing, and engineering tech—dominating with low debt-to-income ratios. The narrative emphasizes how these fields combine high demand with efficient training (e.g., two-year engineering tech programs rivaling four-year degrees). A key insight interrupts the celebration: "Not all engineering is equal. Civil engineers earn 20% less than electrical engineers straight out of school." This subtly nudges readers to dig deeper than broad categories.
3. The Hidden Risks: Biology and Physical Sciences

The tone shifts as we expose the "STEM degrees that act like humanities majors" financially. A red-hued bar chart shows biology and chemistry grads saddled with debt disproportionate to their modest starting salaries. The story personalizes the data with a vignette: "Meet Alex, a biology grad with 42,000indebtanda42,000indebtanda31,000 lab tech job—priced out of renting alone in most cities." A secondary layer acknowledges that many science grads pursue advanced degrees, but notes the long-term gamble: "Even after a PhD, 40% of biologists earn under $60,000."
4. The Big Picture: Mapping the STEM Landscape

A scatterplot visualizes the stark divide, plotting majors by earnings and debt. Computer science and health fields cluster in the "low debt, high income" quadrant, while biology and physics hover near "high debt, low income"—dangerously close to non-STEM fields. Reference lines underscore the median STEM salary (45,000)anddebt(45,000)anddebt(30,000), revealing how many "science" grads fall short. The takeaway is clear: "STEM isn’t a single ladder to prosperity—it’s a fork in the road."
5. The So-What: Choosing with Clarity

The conclusion avoids prescriptive advice, instead urging readers to marry passion with pragmatism. A side-by-side comparison of the top- and bottom-performing majors reinforces the stakes, while a final interactive element invites exploration: "How does your major stack up?" links to a tool filtering earnings and debt by field. The story closes with a provocative question: "When a biology degree costs like an engineer’s but pays like an artist’s—is it still STEM?"*
