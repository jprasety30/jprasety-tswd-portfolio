# Wireframes / storyboards
Based on feedback received from Part One, I decided to narrow down my focus on STEM related majors within the US based on the US Department of Education College Scorecard data updated on 2023.

Storyboard: "The STEM Wealth Divide—Why Some Degrees Pay (and Others Don’t)"
1. Hook: The Broken Promise of STEM

The story opens by challenging the universal assumption that all STEM degrees guarantee financial success. This opening section sets the tone and introduces the central idea of the story: while STEM degrees are generally seen as high-return, the financial reality can vary significantly between specific fields. The visual should capture attention while previewing the tension between high and low ROI within STEM.

- Shorthand Layout: Full-screen image of a graduation cap split down the middle—one side digital (CS), the other side test tubes (Biology).

- Headline: "The STEM Wealth Divide—Why Some Degrees Pay (and Others Don’t)"

- Subhead: "Engineering and computer science majors consistently deliver strong financial returns. But not all science degrees are created equal."

2. The Winners: Tech, Health, and Engineering

Here, we spotlight the STEM fields that live up to the hype. This part of the story identifies the STEM majors with the best financial outcomes, focusing on those with low debt and high early-career income. The goal is to give readers a clear look at which majors provide the strongest return on investment, setting a benchmark for comparison. A dynamic bar chart reveals the top performers, which might be tech—dominated, with low debt-to-income ratios. 

The bar chart highlights the top 10 STEM majors with the lowest debt-to-income ratios, demonstrating which fields provide the most financial relief early on. Nuclear Engineering Technology tops the list with an exceptionally low DTI of 0.11, followed closely by Systems Engineering and various branches of Computer and Electrical Engineering. These programs combine relatively modest debt levels with strong starting salaries—making them standout options for students aiming for strong ROI.

3. The Hidden Risks: Underperforming STEM majors with low earnings

Here, the story shifts to highlight STEM majors that may carry financial risk—those with high debt loads and comparatively low earnings. This contrast builds narrative tension and emphasizes that not all STEM degrees are equally rewarding.

This bar chart shows the 10 STEM majors with the highest debt-to-income ratios one year after graduation. Degrees like Agriculture/Veterinary, Astronomy, and Evolutionary Biology exceed DTI ratios of 1.4–1.8—meaning students owe more than their annual income. Despite being science-focused, these programs may leave graduates in financially vulnerable positions due to high debt or underwhelming salary outcomes.

4. The Big Picture: Mapping the STEM Landscape

A scatterplot visualizes the stark divide, plotting majors by earnings and debt. This visual section brings the contrast full circle by mapping all STEM majors by area of study on a scatter chart. It helps readers visually distinguish between high-return and high-risk majors, reinforcing the central argument that 'STEM' is not a one-size-fits-all financial decision.

The scatterplot compares average earnings against median debt for each STEM major, color-coded by area of study. This layout reveals meaningful clusters: Engineering and Computer Science degrees tend to fall in the bottom-right quadrant—indicating high earnings and low debt. Conversely, many Biological and Physical Science majors appear in the top-left quadrant, signaling low earnings and higher debt. The visualization drives home the point that not all science degrees offer the same financial payoff.

5. The So-What: Choosing with Clarity

This section wraps up the narrative with a reflection on the broader implications of the data. It encourages readers—especially prospective students—to think critically about how their major choice impacts long-term financial health, and offers a visual summary to drive the point home.

- Text Block: "While STEM still leads in overall financial return, new grads should look carefully at which science or tech fields they pursue. Not all offer the same payoff."

# User research 

## Target audience

- Target Audience: Prospective college students (high school juniors/seniors), parents, and college academic advisors who are evaluating degree choices based on financial outcomes.

- Approach to Interviewing:Interviewed three individuals who represent this audience:
  - A college-bound high school senior
  - A parent of a current undergraduate student
  - A university academic advisor

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Evaluate clarity of value communication|What factors do you consider when evaluating a college major?|
|Determine awareness of ROI differences in STEM|Were you aware that debt-to-income ratios vary widely across STEM fields?|
|Assess initial reactions to visuals|Looking at these wireframes/sketches, what stands out to you?|
|Identify effective visual types|Detect points of confusion or improvement|
|Solicit improvement suggestions|What would you change or add to make this more useful?|

## Interview findings

User interviews revealed that viewers found the visualizations engaging and informative, with each chart contributing unique value to the story. The first bar chart showcasing low-risk majors was praised for its clarity, especially with recognizable fields like nursing and engineering. The second chart on high-risk majors was impactful but caused some confusion due to its color scale and lack of reference values. The third scatterplot was seen as the most powerful visual overall, clearly communicating the disparity in outcomes—but it required additional guidance, such as quadrant explanations and income benchmarks. Across all three interviews, participants emphasized the need for clearer definitions of debt-to-income ratio, better labeling, and context to interpret the visuals confidently. These insights directly inform planned design enhancements in Part III, aimed at improving clarity, accessibility, and user comprehension.

| Questions	| Interview 1 (Student)	| Interview 2 (Parent)	| Interview 3 (Advisor) | 
|------|-----------|------|------------------|
|What factors do you consider?	| Future salary, interest, family expectations	| Cost, employability, long-term growth	| Career pathways, graduation rates|
|Aware of ROI differences in STEM?	| Not really, assumed all STEM paid well	| Knew CS paid more, didn’t know specifics	| Aware of differences, not surprised | 
|What stands out in visuals?	| Bar chart with green theme felt encouraging	| The significant contrast between top and bottom majors were significant	| The scatterplot showed contrast and clear value gaps|
|Most informative visual?	| TOP 10 best ROI chart	| Top 10 worst ROI chart | Scatterplot | 
|Anything confusing?	| Didn’t understand “debt-to-income” at first	| Color legend not obvious in chart 2	| Needed more labelling on scatterplot | 
|Suggestions for improvement?	| Add short explanation of how DTI is calculated	| Add earning and debt values on bars| Label axes clearly, add benchmark lines, explain quadrant more (which section is supposed to be good) |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DTI ratio concept unclear to general audiences | Add a 1–2 sentence explainer above each chart and on hover tooltips |
| Color legend in underperforming majors chart unclear | Switch to color ratio between debt and income |
| Scatterplot lacked interpretation guidance | Add labeled reference lines + a quadrant key to explain "best" vs. "worst" zones |
| Audience wants real-world framing (salary, payoff time) | Include tooltips or callouts showing "Avg. $X earnings vs. $Y debt = Z% DTI" |
| Value of nursing/health fields surprised users | Highlight those majors more clearly in text interpretation and chart callouts |

# Final Thoughts
This project aims to bridge the gap between data and decision-making for prospective students and their families. The feedback collected through interviews emphasized not just the value of the visualizations themselves, but the importance of how they are framed and interpreted. As I move into Part III, the focus will be on tightening the narrative, making the charts more intuitive, and giving readers clear takeaways they can act on. Ultimately, the goal is to empower students to choose their major not just based on passion or prestige—but with a clearer understanding of the financial path that comes with it.
