# FINAL PROJECT 1: STUDENT LOAN DEBT by Major and Earnings

# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
The cost of higher education in the U.S. has been rising steadily, but not all degrees offer equal financial returns. For many students, taking on debt is a necessity, yet whether that debt pays off can vary wildly by major. This project will explore the relationship between college majors, student loan debt, and post-graduation earnings, with the goal of answering a critical question: 

Which degrees offer the best return on investment, and which leave graduates financially underwater?

By visualizing this tradeoff across majors, I aim to help future students and families make more informed decisions about college.
This data story will use government-provided and publicly accessible datasets and be presented as an interactive web visualization to make the information digestible and actionable for students, educators, and policymakers alike.


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

1. Introduction – The Debt Dilemma
   Quick context: average student loan debt, public concern.
   Key stat teaser: “The average student borrows $XX—but what they earn after depends on their major.”

2. Degrees of Debt: What Students Owe by Major
   Visualization: Bar chart of average loan amounts by major.
   Highlight: Arts vs. STEM vs. Business vs. Health

3. The Payoff: Median Earnings After Graduation
   Visualization: Scatterplot of major vs. median earnings (1-year and 5-year)
   Layer in gender and race if data allows.

4. Debt-to-Income Ratio: Which Majors Are Trapped?
   Visualization: Debt-to-income ratio heatmap or quadrant plot
   Highlight which majors have the worst (and best) ROI

5. Outliers & Surprises
   Pull out interesting anomalies: e.g. Nursing vs. Biology, CS vs. Physics
   Quotes/stories from alumni or survey responses if possible

6. What majors are working to close the gap?
   Visualization: Line chart highlighting debt-to-income ratio growth for majors with growing income.
   Context: Have a list of colleges with free tuition for related majors, more funding, increased income, etc.

7. Conclusion: What This Means for Students Today
   Pull it all together — key takeaways
   Potential call to action for schools or policymakers


## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
