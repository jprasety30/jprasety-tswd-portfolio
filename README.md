# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Jonathan Bryan Prasetyo, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Information Systems Management – Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA) in the 16-month track at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Informatics with a focus on Data Science from the University of Washington-Seattle.

I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights, tell compelling stories, and drive impactful decisions. My work bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful narratives, combining analytical rigor with visual storytelling to make complex information accessible and actionable.

Beyond data, I have a deep appreciation for football (soccer), movies, and video games, which inspire my approach to storytelling—whether it's analyzing player performance, exploring cinematic trends, or uncovering gaming industry insights.

# What I hope to learn
Listed below are the things I hope to learn from this course:

- Effective Data Visualization Techniques: Learning how to design clear, engaging, and impactful visualizations that effectively communicate insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Narrative-Driven Data Storytelling: Developing the ability to craft compelling stories with data by structuring insights in a way that resonates with stakeholders and drives decision-making.
- Tools & Technologies for Data Communication: Gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Python visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to transform raw data into meaningful and visually appealing reports.
