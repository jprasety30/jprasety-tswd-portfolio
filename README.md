# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Jonathan Bryan Prasetyo, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Information Systems Management – Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM-BIDA) in the 16-month track at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Informatics with a focus on Data Science from the University of Washington-Seattle.

I am passionate about leveraging data to uncover insights, tell compelling stories, and drive impactful decisions. My work bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful narratives, combining analytical rigor with visual storytelling to make complex information accessible and actionable.

Beyond data, I have a deep appreciation for football (soccer), movies, and video games, which inspire my approach to storytelling—whether it's analyzing player performance, exploring cinematic trends, or uncovering gaming industry insights.

# What I hope to learn
Listed below are the things I hope to learn from this course:

- Effective Data Visualization Techniques: Learning how to design clear, engaging, and impactful visualizations that effectively communicate insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- Narrative-Driven Data Storytelling: Developing the ability to craft compelling stories with data by structuring insights in a way that resonates with stakeholders and drives decision-making.
- Tools & Technologies for Data Communication: Gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or Python visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to transform raw data into meaningful and visually appealing reports.

# Portfolio

## Assignment #1: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment #2: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
