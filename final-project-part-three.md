# Changes made since Part II
To improve the clarity and interpretability of my visualizations, I made several key enhancements across all major graphs. First, for the bar charts displaying the Top 10 lowest and Top 10 highest Debt-to-Income (DTI) majors, I added concise captions that explain the meaning of DTI in plain terms. These captions clarify that a lower DTI indicates stronger financial outcomes, where graduates earn more relative to their debt, while a higher DTI suggests potential financial strain.

To aid comparison across charts, I introduced a universal reference line for average DTI. Rather than recalculating based on the filtered top or bottom groups, this benchmark line represents the overall average DTI across all STEM majors. This approach gives viewers a consistent point of reference, allowing them to instantly assess whether each major performs above or below the broader average.

In the scatter plot that maps average debt against average earnings, I further enhanced readability by adding horizontal and vertical reference lines to divide the chart into quadrants. These quadrants visually distinguish majors with high earnings and low debt (financially favorable) from those with low earnings and high debt (financially risky). This layout not only emphasizes the variation within STEM fields but also helps audiences intuitively understand which majors deliver a better return on investment.

Together, these enhancements make the data more accessible, highlight financial disparities between majors, and provide viewers with a clear framework for evaluating educational choices.

## The audience
For my final data story, I identified the primary audience as prospective college students and their families, especially those considering STEM degrees. This includes high school juniors and seniors, college applicants, and their parents who are often key decision-makers when evaluating majors and financial aid options. I also considered college advisors and guidance counselors as a secondary audience, as they play a critical role in guiding students through career planning and major selection.

To narrow this focus, I drew from interview insights collected earlier in the course. Students mentioned prioritizing interest and perceived job prospects, while parents emphasized cost and long-term return. One key finding was that both groups tended to view “STEM” as a safe, uniformly high-paying path—yet most lacked detailed knowledge of how financial outcomes vary within STEM. This misunderstanding became the foundation of my story.

Used AI to fix grammar and workflow.

# Final thoughts
Looking back on the project, I’m proud of how far the data story came—particularly in making a nuanced topic like STEM return-on-investment more visually and conceptually accessible. That said, due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to fully narrow the focus of my story. I initially had a broader vision that included exploring how the rise of AI may have contributed to changes in earning potential across STEM majors—especially given that the dataset spans several years leading up to 2023, aligning with the acceleration of AI-driven job demand. I was excited by the idea of layering in that temporal and technological context, but I had to prioritize core visuals and clarity for a general audience. If I had more time, I would’ve liked to revisit that angle—perhaps through time-series analysis or by incorporating external labor trend data to investigate how fields like Computer Science have shifted in value compared to others. Still, this project gave me a clearer understanding of how storytelling and design choices shape data interpretation, and I’m walking away with stronger tools to build focused, audience-aligned narratives in the future.
